How do I approach designing software?
  I like to look at designing software like a jigsaw puzzle. The base program (everything that gets the program to work) I would consider the edges. It gives us our framework for the rest of the software. Next, I work piece by piece, program by program, slowly putting everything together until I get a complete software.

How do I approach developing programs?
  Much like developing software, programs are just smaller pictures within a puzzle. Looking at how I need the program to work, I piece it all together until the program works. It could be a simple program that only requires a few lines or a complex picture that needs me to do a lot of research and hours of work. Either way, I try to get everything to work like a puzzle, something that I enjoy doing.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  My ultimate end goal is to get into game programming and so far computer science has helped me immensely with my coding skills. I have learned a lot of different programming languages and other differnt skills, such as UnReal. Everything has been super helpful in my goals.
